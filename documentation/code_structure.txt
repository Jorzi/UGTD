Code structure

The main element of the game is the GameInstance.
It exteds a JPanel and therefore works as the canvas for all the game graphics. 
It also contains the game loop as well as nested classes for mouse and keyboard input.
Currently the enemy objects are handled, created and updated by the GameInstance's EnemyHandler object, while the Towers are directly kept track of by the gameInstance object itself.

The Terrainmap object is linked directly to both the GameInstance and the EnemyHandler, since they both need to access MapTiles by their xy-coordinates. It is currently responsible for both pathfinding and generating the map from a bitmap image.

To avoid loading the same image multiple times, the images are all preloaded and accessed from an image library in the ImageLoader class. Every class that represents a graphical object has its own draw method(s).
