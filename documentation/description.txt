Subject: Tower defence game

A single-player strategy game where enemies appear on a map and navigate themselves towards a target. 
The objective is to place towers in order to destroy the enemies before they can reach the target.
Enemies do not attack towers an must navigate around them, thus possibly lengthening the path they have to travel.
Towers can be placed in any configuration but must allow at least one free path for the enemies to reach the target.
The amount of towers the player can place are dependent on the price of the tower and the amount of credits available to the player.
Credits are either a fixed amount, or are earned by destroying enemies.
If too many enemies reach the target, the game ends.
The scores are counted according to the amount of enemies destroyed before the game ends.
