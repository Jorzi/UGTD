 * The MapTile represents a node in the graph which is the traversable area of the map.
 * It has information about neighboring tiles as well as the enemy/tower currently occupying the tile
 * In theory it could be occupied by a tower and an enemy at the same time, but the game sees that it doesn't happen.
